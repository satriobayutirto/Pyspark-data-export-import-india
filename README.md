in this prjoect i will try to analyst export and import from india dataset

1. this datset contain 5 column. namely id,  commodity , value (price), year and country
2. for first step check dataset in export data there 10.4% from 184755 row is null in value and in import there 15.58% from 101051 row is null in value. there no dupiclate.but we will keep all row for analysis
3. after that extract all string in comodity unique value then imput all unique to ai text machine to make group by category
4. the category
    "Animal Products",
    "Vegetable Products",
    "Textile and Apparel Products" ,
    "Chemical Products",    "Metal Products",
    "Machinery and Electronics",
    "Mineral and Fuel Products",
    "Food and Beverages",
    "Wood and Paper Products",
    "Leather and Animal Skin Products",
    "Plastic and Rubber Products",
    "Miscellaneous"
5.  after make the new column and one hot encoding if that word in category
6.  After that make graph for analysis
  ![Import Exprt Total Category](picture/importexporttotal.png)
from that chart, the highest value for import exports is in the metal and fuel category and the lowest for imports is animal products and exports are wood and paper products. this indicates that the country is in great need of high fuel resources and is exchanged for mining products produced besides that the need for animal products has been met due to the small amount of imports. for the wood and paper industry needs to be increased because exports are the lowest and lower than imports. this indicates that the need for wood and paper is still not met

     From both graphs, it can be seen that every year the need for animal products is decreasing and for vegetables is increasing. This indicates that the global community is starting to realize the importance of healthy food.

    on this graph it can be seen that in 2015-2016 we managed to increase exports and reduce imports for the animal skin and leather category and peaked in 2017. the export trend continued to decline and bottomed out in 2020-2021 but our imports remained the same. this indicates a problem with our products or the global market is not doing well
